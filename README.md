# Regency
Network Modeling and other machine learning uses aimed towards a system for adding an *AD&D 2nd Edition Birthright*-like regency system to a 5e  D&D World of my own design.  After trying to convert the actual system, the game was too complicated and was too memory-intensive to run reasonably.  The result is I designed my own system that will concurrently be updated with the game until both work the way I want them to.
